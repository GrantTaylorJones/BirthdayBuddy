# Birthday Buddy
Daily alert services of family and friends' birthdays on said day.
A service or function app will be triggered by a daily chrono trigger, and poll the current date on a data store. All names with primary key (or identifier/link) will be sent via sms or email to the user.

The goal of this project is as stated, but also to acheive reusability, and ease of deployment. The end product should be easy for others to deploy with their specific dataset of birthdays.

This will be done with ARM templates.
